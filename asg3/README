main.cpp:
	File creates two random graphs with 10 nodes each, and prints their representation and other informatoin
        about them in "RandomGraphs.txt," to illustrate simple examples of my Graph class's functionality.
	
	A graph is then called with 20% edge density, using default number of nodes (50) and edge weight range	
	[1.0,10.0]. This graph, along with the paths between node 0 to node x ( 1<=x<=49) are printed to 	
	"Graph_20%". At the	the bottom of the file, the average path cost is printed.
	
	Similar functionality occurs for a graph with 40% density.
