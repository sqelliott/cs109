main.cpp:
	Runs the Prim minimimum spanning tree algorithm on three graphs.
	First takes my own 10-node graph from 'graph1.txt' to produce graph and
	produce the corresponding MST.
	Then produces a random graph wiht 100 nodes, 30% density and produces
	that graphs corresponding MST.
	Finally, takes the sample graph from coursera, and does the same.
	Output of the process I ran saved to 'graph.out'
