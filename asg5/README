main.cpp:
	runs a sample random game of my Hex implentation. Displays the
	board after each move is made. Shows error checking my not allowing	
	players to make moves on occupied spots or illegal spots.
	Once a player has reached both walls the game is set to end state,
	and players are no longer allowed to make more moves. Displays the end board
	and the winner.
