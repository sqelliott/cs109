# HW2 Dijkstra

Graph ADT

  * Dijkstra as class member function

Problem:

  * set of constructors for declaring/initializing a graph
  * edge has positive cost (distance)
  * procedure to randomly generate a set of edges w/ pos. distances
    * undirected graphs
    * parameters: edge density, distance range
  * output: average path length calculation
