main.cpp:
	Runs a game of hex against a computer AI. AI is a basic hex player
	that attempts to connects its own walls while blocking its opponents.
	Each time it is the AI's turn, it runs the min-max algorith, with alpha-beta efficiency
	checks, to determine the value of each possible move based on the current stateo of
	the game, selecting the highest valued move. The min-max algorithm recursively
	evaluates possible games states, up to a determined depth (for memory and time sake)
	using a heuristic function on leaf nodes. 
	The heuristic involves attempting to get the AI's path to stretch from its left wall 
	to the right wall, while discouraging moves that allow its opponents to come closer
	to connecting their wall.
